## 2025-03-18 - Initialized Project Structure and PRD for Superwall MCP Server

### Files Updated:
- `tasks.markdown`: Created the initial Product Requirements Document and task breakdown.

### Description:
Created the `tasks.markdown` file to outline the architecture, goals, features, and specific sub-tasks required for building the Superwall MCP server. This provides a clear plan and requirements for the project.

### Reasoning:
Based on the user's request to architect the solution and create tasks before implementation. This ensures alignment on the scope and approach for building the MCP server to interact with Superwall APIs via an LLM in the IDE. The architecture uses Node.js/TypeScript as it's better suited for backend services than React Native.

### Trade-offs:
- Opted for Node.js/TypeScript over the user's initial mention of React Native, as RN is unsuitable for backend MCP server implementations. This ensures a more standard, maintainable, and performant solution.
- The initial task breakdown focuses on core Paywall management as the MVP. Campaign management is included as a potential scope but might be deferred.

### Considerations:
- The success of this project heavily relies on the capabilities and documentation of the Superwall Management API. Further investigation into specific API endpoints will be needed during Phase 2.
- Security is paramount; API keys must be handled securely via environment variables.

### Future Work:
- Execute the tasks outlined in `tasks.markdown`, starting with Phase 1 (Project Setup).
- Refine the task list and estimates as API details become clearer.
- Implement Campaign management features post-MVP.

## 2025-03-18 - Created README.md

### Files Updated:
- `README.md`: Created the initial README file for the project.

### Description:
Generated a basic `README.md` file outlining the project's purpose, planned features, setup instructions, and how to run the server. It includes placeholders for planned MCP tools.

### Reasoning:
To provide essential documentation for anyone interacting with the project, following standard software development practices. This fulfills Task 4.4 from the `tasks.markdown` plan, although done earlier in the setup phase.

### Trade-offs:
- The README is based on the planned architecture and features; it will need updates as development progresses and API details are confirmed.

### Considerations:
- Includes sections for environment setup and running the server, which are crucial for usability.
- Lists planned MCP tools to give an idea of the intended functionality.

### Future Work:
- Keep the README updated as features are implemented and API details become clearer.
- Add contribution guidelines and a license if needed.
